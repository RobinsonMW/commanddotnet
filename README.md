# CommandDotNet

### A modern framework for building modern CLI apps

Out of the box support for commands, sub-commands, validations, dependency injection, 
piping and streaming, enums & custom types, typo suggestions, prompting, passwords, response files and much more! 
See the [features page](https://commanddotnet.bilal-fazlani.com/features). 

Favors [POSIX conventions](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html)

Includes [test tools](TestTools/overview.md) used by the framework to test all features of the framework.

Modify and extend the functionality of the framework through configuration and middleware.

## Support

For bugs, [create an issue](https://github.com/bilal-fazlani/commanddotnet/issues/new)

For questions and feature requests, start [a discussion](https://github.com/bilal-fazlani/commanddotnet/discussions)

### Example

```c#
public class Calculator
{
    public void Add(int value1, int value2)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Answer:  {value1 + value2}");
    }

    public void Subtract(int value1, int value2)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Answer:  {value1 - value2}");
    }
}
```

```c#
class Program
{
    static int Main(string[] args)
    {
        return new AppRunner<Calculator>().Run(args);
    }
}
```

With these two classes, we've defined an Add and Subtract command and help is automatically generated.

```bash
~
$ dotnet calc.dll -h
Usage: dotnet calc.dll

Usage: dotnet calc.dll [command]

Commands:

  Add
  Subtract

Use "dotnet calc.dll [command] --help" for more information about a command.

~
$ dotnet calc.dll Add -h
Usage: dotnet calc.dll Add [arguments]

Arguments:

  value1  <NUMBER>

  value2  <NUMBER>

~
$ dotnet calc.dll Add 40 20
Answer: 60
```
